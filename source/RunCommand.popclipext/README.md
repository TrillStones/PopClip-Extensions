# Terminal

Runs the selected text as a command in the current terminal window.

One can choose either default Terminal, [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/),
[Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) or [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/).

## Features

- Execute selected text as a command in your terminal of choice
- Optionally prepend text before the selected command
- Optionally append text after the selected command
- Run commands in a new tab instead of the current tab

### Usage Examples

1. **Basic command execution**: Select a command like `ls -la` and run it
   directly.

2. **Prepend example**: Set "Prepend Command" to `sudo` to run selected commands
   with sudo privileges.

3. **Append example**: Set "Append Command" to `| grep keyword` to filter
   command output.

4. **Combining prepend and append**: Set "Prepend Command" to `sudo` and "Append
   Command" to `| tee output.log` to run with sudo and save output to a file.

## Configuration

In the extension settings, you can configure:

- Terminal Emulator: Choose between Terminal, iTerm2, or Warp
- Prepend Command: Text to insert before the selected text (optional)
- Append Command: Text to insert after the selected text (optional)
- Use New Tab: Opens command in a new tab instead of the current tab
